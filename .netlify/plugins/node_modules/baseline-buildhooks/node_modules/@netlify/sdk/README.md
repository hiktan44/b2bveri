### Manifest.json

The `manifest.json` gets generated whenever the `build` command is run and can be found in the `.ntli/site/static` folder of an extension project. It is a JSON file that contains the metadata of the extension that has been created. It is used in the following ways:
- The Netlify UI uses it to display the correct information about an extension 
- The Netlify UI uses it to determine whether the extension is a connector
- The Netlify UI uses it to help the UI pass a header to Jigsaw with the correct API version
- Netlify build services use it to determine whether the extension contains a build event handler

Please note, that the above may not be an exhaustive list of uses for the `manifest.json`.
